## Class

### Class is special type of value in an object oriented programming.

### A class is essentially a custom type that has some special properties.

## Object

### An object is an instance of a class type.

## In object-oriented programming, we create special types called "classes". And each instance of a class is called an "object".

### the constructor is the init() method, and it is called when a new object is created.

### If a class is just a type, then an object is just a value.

### In object-oriented programming, an instance is a concrete occurrence of any object... "Instance" is synonymous with "object" as they are each a particular value... "Instance" emphasizes the distinct identity of the object. The creation of an instance is called instantiation.

### I can create three different "instances" of the class. Or in other words, I'll create three separate objects.

south_wall = Wall(1, 2, 3)
north_wall = Wall(4, 5, 6)
east_wall = Wall(9, 8, 7)

### Class variables vs instacne variables

## Instance Variables

### Instance variables vary from object to object and are declared in the constructor.

### Class variables remain the same between instances of the same class and are declared at the top level of a class definition.
